# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## User Story

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. For this project i have built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

i have created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality .
